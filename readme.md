# Content based filtering
This project demonstrates the application of content-based filtering using the Alternating Least Squares (ALS) algorithm with the MovieLens small dataset. The system recommends movies based on their content characteristics, leveraging user ratings to enhance the recommendation quality.

Note: The system requires users to log in or register to view recommendations. This approach simplifies the process of generating personalized recommendations for each individual.

Note: Content-based filtering does not incorporate user ratings into its recommendation logic; instead, user ratings are utilized primarily for aesthetic purposes..
